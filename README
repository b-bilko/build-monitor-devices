rainboduino_v1_0_7 has firmware to support sending lighting commands to a SeeedStudio (Seeed Studio) 
4x4x4 LED cube whose master controller is the Rainbowduino Arduino clone.  
This firmware was submitted to seed studio but never published.  

rgb_pwm_serial is Arduino firmware that supports several different lighting configurations originally intended to act as build notification lights.
This could actually be used for anything.  It supports two RGB lights using Arduino Uno integrated PWM, 4 RGB lights using the JeeNodes port expander and 32 lights using a Sparkfun addressable led strip.
Different commands speak to different devices so no software changes are required.
