rainboduino_v1_0_7 has firmware to support sending lighting commands to a SeeedStudio (Seeed Studio) 
4x4x4 LED cube whose master controller is the Rainbowduino Arduino clone.  
This firmware was submitted to seed studio but never published.  

rgb_pwm_serial is Arduino firmware that supports several different lighting configurations originally intended to act as build notification lights.
This could actually be used for anything.  It supports two RGB lights using Arduino Uno integrated PWM, 4 RGB lights using the JeeNodes port expander and 32 lights using a Sparkfun addressable led strip.
Different commands speak to different devices so no software changes are required.

Freemometer is firmware for an Arduino based device built into an Ikea Dekad retro-style alarm clock.
The hands are replaced by a servo.  An LED is added to the front and the mechanical ringer is also
controlled by the Arduino.  Commands are sent to the Arduino over USB serial port or via bluetooth
depending on the hardware. The firmware supports various patterns for the LED and mechanical bell.

ti_launchpad_rgb firmware for an MSP430 launchpad with a single RGB LED.  It allows full PWM control
and provides the same LED blink patterns that the Freemoemter provides for it's LED and mecahnical bell.
Ts the simplest device to make and costs around $10 including the TI MSP430 Launchpad in 2012.
